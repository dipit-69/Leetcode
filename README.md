## ðŸ§  Problem 2: Products that are Both Low Fat and Recyclable

### ðŸ’¬ Question:

You are given a `Products` table with columns `product_id`, `low_fats`, and `recyclable`. Both `low_fats` and `recyclable` are ENUM values that can be `'Y'` or `'N'`.

Your task is to find all product IDs for which both `low_fats` and `recyclable` are `'Y'`.

#### Example:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

Output should be:

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

### âœ… Solution (SQL):

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
